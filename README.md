## 🛠️ Development Workflow

Our agile development process follows the Scrum methodology, with regular sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews. The Scrum Master, Chad Bosch, is responsible for ensuring the team's adherence to Scrum principles and facilitating smooth communication.

### Sprint Planning

At the beginning of each sprint, the team conducts a sprint planning session. During this meeting, the Product Manager, Chad Bosch, presents the prioritized user stories and features for the upcoming sprint. The team collaboratively estimates the effort required for each task and commits to a set of deliverables for the sprint.

### Daily Stand-ups

We conduct daily stand-up meetings to keep everyone in the loop and address any challenges. Each team member provides a brief update on their progress, highlights any impediments, and communicates their plan for the day. This short, focused meeting ensures that everyone is on the same page and can quickly address any blockers.

### Sprint Reviews

At the end of each sprint, the team holds a sprint review to showcase the completed worrk. This session allows for feedback and discussions on the features delivered during the sprint.

### Branching Strategy

We use a branching strategy to manage code changes efficiently. When contributing to the project, follow these steps:

For contributing to the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Fetch the latest changes from the main branch: `git fetch origin main`
3. Merge the latest changes into your branch: `git merge origin/main`
4. Implement your changes and test thoroughly.
5. Push your branch to the repository: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
6. Submit a pull request for review.
